## Logging Configuration
logging.level.com.example.productioReady.productioReady.clients=DEBUG

# by default, spring boot uses logback for logging
# to change the logging framework, you can exclude the default logging dependency and add your preferred one
# for example, to use log4j2, you can add the following dependency in your build file
# implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-log4j2'
# in log4j2, by default only error level logs are printed to the console
# if you want to see debug level logs, you need to configure log4j2.properties or log4j2.xml accordingly
# in log4j2, we have
#    - error level logs for production issues
#    - warn level logs for potential issues
#    - info level logs for general information
#    - debug level logs for development and troubleshooting
#    - trace level logs for very detailed logs
# by default, only error level logs, are printed to the console in log4j2
# to see debug level logs, you need to configure log4j2.properties or log4

logging.level.root =DEBUG

# by default, root level is set to info which means only info, warn and error level logs are printed to the console
# to change the root logging level, you can set logging.level.root property
# logging.level.root=DEBUG
