// steps to enable hot reload

1 - ctrl + alt + s - will open preferences
2 - go to Build, execution, deployment
3 - go to compiler
4 - tick "Build project automatically"
5 - In Advanced Settings, go to compiler section and tick "Allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running"

we can also control from properties
spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true

if you want to exclude some packages to not trigger the restart
spring.devtools.restart.exclude=src/main/java/com/example/productioReady/productioReady/dto/**

making 3rd party api calls
There are some ways to make 3rd party api calls in spring boot
1 - Rest Template (Deprecated)
2 - Web Client
3 - Rest Client

Rest Client is blocking means synchronous
Web Client is non-blocking means asynchronous

after adding spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency we can monitor our application health
http://localhost:8080/actuator/

output -
{
"_links": {
"self": {
"href": "http://localhost:9000/actuator",
"templated": false
},
"health": {
"href": "http://localhost:9000/actuator/health",
"templated": false
},
"health-path": {
"href": "http://localhost:9000/actuator/health/{*path}",
"templated": true
}
}
}

some famous actuator endpoints
/actuator/health -> shows application health
/actuator/metrics -> shows application metrics
/actuator/loggers -> shows application log levels
/actuator/threaddump -> shows thread dump of the application
/actuator/httptrace -> shows http trace of the application
/actuator/env -> shows environment properties
/actuator/info -> shows application info
/actuator/mappings -> shows all the request mappings
/actuator/prometheus -> shows prometheus metrics
/actuator/conditions -> shows auto-configuration conditions


To enable all actuator endpoints, add the following line to application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
To enable specific actuator endpoints, add the following line to application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
